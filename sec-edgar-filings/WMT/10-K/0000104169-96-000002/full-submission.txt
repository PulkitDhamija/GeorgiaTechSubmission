ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

          (a)  General Development of Business

                Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  (together  with  its  subsidiaries
hereinafter  referred  to  as the "Company") has become  America's  largest
retailer  and during the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996, had net  sales
of  $93,627,000,000.   The Company serves customers primarily  through  the
operation  of  Wal-Mart stores (discount department  stores),  Sam's  Clubs
(warehouse membership clubs), and Wal-Mart Supercenters (a combination full-
line supermarket and discount department store).  Domestically, the Company
operated   1,995  Wal-Mart  stores,  433  Sam's  Clubs,  and  239  Wal-Mart
Supercenters  as  of  January  31, 1996.  A table  summarizing  information
concerning  domestic  Wal-Mart stores, Sam's Clubs, Wal-Mart  Supercenters,
and other stores operated since January 31, 1991 is set forth in Schedule A
to Item I found on page 9 of this annual report.

               In fiscal 1992, the Company entered into a joint venture, in
which  it  has  a  50% interest with CIFRA, Mexico's largest  retailer,  to
develop and expand retailing services in Mexico.  At January 31, 1996,  the
joint  venture operated 28 warehouse clubs, 25 discount stores, 13 Wal-Mart
Supercenters,  four combination stores, three supermarkets, five  specialty
department stores, and 48 restaurants.

                In fiscal 1993, the Company entered the Puerto Rico market,
and  at  January  31, 1996, operated seven Wal-Mart stores and  four  Sam's
Clubs.

               In fiscal 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of 122
Woolco  department stores located in Canada from Woolworth Canada, Inc.,  a
subsidiary   of  Woolworth  Corporation.   The  acquisition  included   all
inventory,  leasehold  interests and other assets  at  each  location.   At
January 31, 1996, the Company operated 131 Canadian Wal-Mart stores.

                In fiscal 1995, the Company entered into a joint venture in
which  it  has a 60% interest with Lojas Americanas, a leading retailer  in
Brazil,  to develop and operate Supercenters and warehouse clubs in Brazil.
At  January 31, 1996, the joint venture operated two Supercenters and three
warehouse clubs.

                In  fiscal  1996,  the Company entered  Argentina,  and  at
January  31,  1996, the Company operated one Supercenter and two  warehouse
clubs.

                In  fiscal  1996, the Company and Lippo Group of  Indonesia
signed an agreement to open Indonesia's first Wal-Mart Supercenter in early
1996.   The  Company will provide retail expertise and management  services
for  the  operation of the store, and ownership will be held by  the  Lippo
Group.

                A  table  summarizing information concerning  international
units operated since fiscal 1992 is set forth in Schedule B to Item 1 found
on page 10 of this annual report.


          (b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments

                Sales  of merchandise through stores which include Wal-Mart
stores,  Sam's  Clubs,  and Wal-Mart Supercenters is the  only  significant
industry segment of which the Company is a part.  Reference is made to  the
financial  information incorporated by reference in  this  report  for  the
financial results of the Company's operations.


          (c)  Narrative Description of Business

                The  Company,  a  Delaware corporation, has  its  principal
offices in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Although the Company was incorporated in
October  1969, the businesses conducted by its predecessors began  in  1945
when  Sam  M.  Walton  opened  a franchise Ben Franklin  variety  store  in
Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar
store  in  Versailles,  Missouri.  Until 1962, the Company's  business  was
devoted  entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In  that  year,  the
first  Wal-Mart Discount City (referred to herein as "Wal-Mart store")  was
opened.   In  fiscal 1984, the Company opened its first three Sam's  Clubs,
and in fiscal 1988, its first Wal-Mart Supercenter.  Through the years, the
Company  has  made certain strategic acquisitions that have  supported  the
growth  of  the  Wal-Mart  stores, clubs  and  Supercenters,  such  as  the
acquisition  of  ten  full service and four specialty distribution  centers
through  the  purchase of McLane Company, Inc., which sells and distributes
merchandise  to  the  convenience store industry and  a  variety  of  other
retailers, the acquisition of selected assets of Pace Membership Warehouse,
Inc.,  and the acquisition of selected assets related to 122 Woolco  stores
in   Canada   from  Woolworth  Canada,  Inc.,  a  subsidiary  of  Woolworth
Corporation.

           General.  The Company operates Wal-Mart stores in all 50 states.
The  average size of a Wal-Mart store is approximately 91,100 square  feet,
and  store sizes generally range between 30,000 and 150,000 square feet  of
building  area.   The Company operates Wal-Mart Supercenter  stores  in  22
states, and the average size of a Supercenter store is 182,000 square feet.

           The Company operates Sam's Clubs in 48 states.  The average size
of  a  Sam's  Club  is approximately 121,000 square feet,  and  club  sizes
generally range between 90,000 and 150,000 square feet of building area.

           The  Company operates Wal-Mart stores, Sam's Clubs and  Wal-Mart
Supercenters  in  Argentina,  Canada and Puerto  Rico,  and  through  joint
ventures in Brazil and Mexico.

           During  the  last fiscal year, no single store or club  location
accounted for as much as 1% of sales or net income.

           Merchandise.   Wal-Mart stores are generally organized  with  40
departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise, including apparel  for
women,  girls,  men, boys, and infants.  Each store also carries  curtains,
fabrics  and  notions,  shoes,  housewares,  hardware,  electronics,   home
furnishings, small appliances, automotive accessories, garden equipment and
supplies,  sporting goods, toys, cameras and supplies,  health  and  beauty
aids, pharmaceuticals, and jewelry.

           Nationally  advertised merchandise accounts for  a  majority  of
sales  of  the stores.  The Company markets lines of merchandise under  the
store  brands  "Sam's  American  Choice", "Great  Value",  "Ol'  Roy",  and
"Equate".   The  Company also markets lines of merchandise  under  licensed
brands;  some of which include "Sports Afield", "House Beautiful", "Popular
Mechanics", "Better Homes & Gardens", "Kathie Lee", and "Bobbie Brooks".

           During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996, domestic sales of
general  merchandise at Wal-Mart stores and Supercenters (which are subject
to  seasonal variance), including licensed departments, by product category
were as follows:


                                              PERCENTAGE
          CATEGORY                             OF SALES

          Softgoods/domestics..............        25%
          Hardgoods........................        25
          Stationery and candy.............        11
          Records and electronics..........        10
          Pharmaceuticals..................         9
          Sporting goods and toys..........         9
          Health and beauty aids...........         7
          Shoes............................         2
          Jewelry..........................         2
                                                  100%


           Sales in pharmaceuticals are a combination of owned and licensed
departments.    While   these  percentages  include   sales   of   licensed
departments, the Company records as other income only rentals received from
such departments.

           Sam's  offers bulk displays of name brand hardgood  merchandise,
some  softgoods,  and institutional size grocery items.   Each  Sam's  also
carries jewelry, sporting goods, toys, tires, stationery, and books.   Most
clubs have fresh food departments which include bakery, meat, and produce.

          McLane offers a wide variety of grocery and non-grocery products,
including  perishable  and non-perishable items.  The non-grocery  products
consist  primarily  of tobacco products, hardgood merchandise,  health  and
beauty aids, toys, and stationery.  McLane is a wholesale distributor  that
sells  its  merchandise to a variety of retailers, including the  Company's
Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters, and Sam's Clubs.

           Operations.   Except for extended hours during  certain  holiday
seasons,  the  majority of the Wal-Mart stores are open from 9:00  a.m.  to
9:00 p.m. six (6) days a week, and from 12:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Sundays,
with  the  remainder of the stores being closed on Sunday.   Some  Wal-Mart
stores and most of the Supercenter stores are currently open 24 hours  each
day.   Wal-Mart stores maintain uniform prices, except where  lower  prices
are  necessary to meet local competition.  Sales are primarily on  a  self-
service, cash-and-carry basis with the objective of maximizing sales volume
and  inventory  turnover  while  minimizing  expenses.   Bank  credit  card
programs,  operated without recourse to the Company, are available  in  all
stores.    Wal-Mart  stores  and  Supercenters  maintain  a   "satisfaction
guaranteed" program to promote customer goodwill and acceptance.

           Sam's  Clubs  are  membership only,  cash-and-carry  operations.
However,  a  financial  service  credit card  program  (Discover  Card)  is
available  in  all clubs and the "Sam's Direct" commercial finance  program
and  "Business  Revolving  Credit"  are available  to  qualifying  business
members.  Also, a "Personal Credit" program is available to qualifying club
members.   Club  members include businesses and those individuals  who  are
members  of certain qualifying organizations, such as government and  state
employees  and credit union members.  Both business and individual  members
have an annual membership fee of $25 for the primary membership card.

           Operating hours vary among Sam's Clubs, but generally  they  are
open  Monday  through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.  Most  Sam's  are
open weekend hours of 9:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Saturday and 12:00 noon  to
6:00 p.m. on Sunday.

           Distribution.  During the 1996 fiscal year, approximately 85% of
the  Wal-Mart  stores' and Supercenters' purchases were shipped  from  Wal-
Mart's  31  distribution centers, five located in Arkansas; five in  Texas;
two  in California, Indiana, New York, and South Carolina; and one each  in
Alabama,  Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,  Mississippi,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.  The balance was shipped
directly to the stores from suppliers.  Each of the distribution centers is
designed to serve the distribution needs of approximately 80 to 140  stores
depending  on  the  size  of the center.  The size  of  these  distribution
centers  range from approximately 700,000 to 1,600,000 square feet.   Sam's
Clubs  receive  the majority of their merchandise via direct shipment  from
suppliers rather than from the Company's distribution centers.

           The  McLane  distribution  centers  buy,  sell,  and  distribute
merchandise  primarily  to the convenience store industry,  and  they  also
service  Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters and Sam's Clubs.  The McLane Company
has  23  distribution centers with five located in Texas,  two  located  in
Arizona, California, Utah, and Virginia, and one each in Colorado, Florida,
Georgia,  Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, New York,  Washington,
and Mexico.

           Merchandising.   Substantially all purchasing and  merchandising
for  all  stores is controlled from the home offices of the Company through
centralized buying and planning practices.  During the fiscal year 1996, no
single supplier to the stores accounted for more than 4.3% of the Company's
purchases.

           Store  Management.  Every retail outlet is managed  by  a  store
manager  or  club general manager and one or more assistant store  or  club
managers.   The Company maintains training programs for managers, assistant
managers  and department managers.  The Company is committed to an  ongoing
training  program  in  an  effort  to  assure  well  trained  future  store
management.

           Expansion Plans.  Domestically, the Company plans to open 60  to
70  new Wal-Mart stores and 100 to 110 Supercenters.  Approximately  90  of
the  Supercenters will come from relocations or expansions of existing Wal-
Mart  stores.  The Company also plans to open 10 new Sam's Clubs and  three
distribution centers.  International expansion includes 25 to 30  new  Wal-
Mart  stores,  Supercenters and Sam's Clubs in Argentina,  Brazil,  Canada,
China,  Indonesia, Mexico and Puerto Rico.  The Company expenses its start-
up  costs  for  each  new unit during the first full  month  of  operation.
Delays   may   be  experienced  in  projected  opening  dates  because   of
construction  problems,  weather  and  other  reasons.   There  can  be  no
assurance that planned expansion will proceed as scheduled.

           Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The  Company's  business  is
seasonal  to  a  certain extent.  Generally, the highest  volume  of  sales
occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during the
first fiscal quarter.

           Competition.  The Company's Wal-Mart stores compete  with  other
discount,  department, drug, variety, and specialty stores, many  of  which
are national chains.  Sam's Clubs compete with wholesale clubs, as well  as
with   discount  retailers,  wholesale  grocers,  and  general  merchandise
wholesalers and distributors.  The Wal-Mart Supercenters compete with other
supercenter  type  stores,  discount stores,  supermarkets,  and  specialty
stores,  many  of which are national or regional chains.  The Company  also
competes for new store sites.  As of January 31, 1996, based on net  sales,
the Company ranked first among all retail department store chains and among
all discount department store chains.

          The Company's competitive position within the industry is largely
determined  by  the  Company's ability to offer value and  service  to  its
customers.   The Company has many programs designed to meet the competitive
needs  of  its  industry.  These include the "Everyday  Low  Price",  "Item
Merchandising",  "Store-Within-a-Store",  "Our  Business  is  Saving   Your
Business Money", and "Buy America" programs.  Although the Company believes
it  has  had a major influence in most of the retail markets in  which  its
stores are located, there is no assurance that this will continue.

           Employees (Associates).  As of January 31, 1996, the Company had
approximately  675,000  associates, an  increase  of  approximately  53,000
associates  for  the  year.   Part-time  associates  are  primarily   sales
personnel.  Associates who are in supervisory and management positions  are
compensated  on a salaried basis; store managers and club general  managers
receive  additional compensation based on their unit's profits.  All  other
store associates are compensated on an hourly basis with the opportunity of
receiving   additional   incentive  bonuses  based   upon   the   Company's
productivity and profitability.

          The Company maintains profit sharing plans under which most full-
and  many  part-time associates become participants following one  year  of
employment   with  the  Company.   Annual  contributions,  based   on   the
profitability  of  the  Company, are made at the  sole  discretion  of  the
Company.   For  the  fiscal  years ended January  31,  1991  through  1996,
contributions  of  approximately $98,000,000,  $130,000,000,  $166,000,000,
$166,000,000, $175,000,000 and $204,000,000, respectively, have been made.

           The  Company also offers an associate stock ownership plan  that
provides for the voluntary purchase of the Company's common stock,  with  a
15%  match  by the Company on up to $1,800 of annual stock purchases.   The
Company  also  has  stock  option  plans that  provide  certain  management
associates an opportunity to share in the long-term success of the Company.
At  January  31, 1996, there were approximately 5,000 management associates
who had been granted stock options by the Company.

            The  Company  owns  1,123  properties  on  which  domestic  Wal-Mart

leases  for  its  stores provide for fixed annual rentals and,  in  many  cases,
the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume.

           The  Company  operated  31 Wal-Mart distribution  facilities  and  23
McLane   distribution  facilities  at  January  31,  1996.   These  distribution
facilities  are  primarily  owned by the Company, and  several  are  subject  to
mortgage  securing  loans.   Some  of  the distribution  facilities  are  leased
under  industrial  development  bond  financing  arrangements  and  provide  the
option  of  purchasing  these  facilities at the  end  of  the  lease  term  for
nominal amounts.

           The  Company  leases  properties on which  Canadian  Wal-Mart  stores
and  Puerto  Rico  Wal-Mart  stores and Sam's Clubs are  located.   The  Company
owns  properties  on  which  the  operating  units  in  Argentina,  Brazil   and
Mexico are located.

Texas.

business.

                            ARTICLE I
                             GENERAL
     1.1  Purpose

     The purpose of the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Officer Deferred
Compensation Plan ("Plan") is to:  (a) attract and retain the
valuable services of certain officers; (b) recognize, reward, and
encourage contributions by such officers to the success of Wal-
Mart Stores, Inc. ("Wal-Mart"); and (c) enable such officers to
defer certain compensation and bonuses and to be credited with
earnings and Incentive Payments with respect to such amounts.

     1.2  Effective Date -- Applicability to Prior Deferred
          Compensation Agreements.

     This Plan is effective February 1, 1996 with respect to
compensation and bonuses deferred (and credited earnings thereon)
under the Plan on or after February 1, 1996.

     In addition, prior to February 1, 1995, certain Eligible
Officers entered into deferred compensation agreements ("Prior
Agreements") with Wal-Mart containing terms similar to those
contained in this Plan.  Except as expressly provided in Sections
5.5 and 5.6 below, effective February 1, 1996 the Prior
Agreements are amended and restated in the form of this Plan and
thereafter the terms of this Plan will govern all benefits
previously governed by the Prior Agreements.

     1.3  Nature of Plan.

     The Plan is intended to be (and will be administered as) an
unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of
management or highly compensated employees under the provisions
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").
It is intended that the Plan be "unfunded" for federal tax
purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA.  Any and all
payments to a Participant under the Plan will be made solely from
Wal-Mart's general assets.  A Participant's interests under the
Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets
of Wal-Mart or any Related Affiliate.  Nothing herein shall be
deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary
relationship between Wal-Mart, any Related Affiliate or the
Committee, and a Participant, the Participant's beneficiary or
any other person.  To the extent any person acquires a right to
receive payments from Wal-Mart under this Plan, such right is no
greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor of
Wal-Mart.

                      ARTICLE II
                     DEFINITIONS

     Compensation, Deferred Bonuses, Incentive Payments, and
     credited earnings thereon.

     as from time to time defined in the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
     Profit Sharing Plan.  A Participant must establish to the
     satisfaction of the Committee that a Disability exists.  A
     Participant shall be treated as having a Disability only if
     such illness or injury results in the Participant's
     Termination of Employment.

          (g)  Early Retirement means a Participant's Termination
     of Employment on or after the date the Participant has been
     continuously employed with Wal-Mart or a Related Affiliate
     twenty (20) or more years.

          (h)  Eligible Officer means an individual who is a
     corporate officer of Wal-Mart and who holds the title of
     Vice President or above, Treasurer, Controller, or an
     officer title of similar rank as determined by the
     Committee.  In addition, Eligible Officer shall include a
     divisional officer of Wal-Mart and who holds the title of
     Vice President or above or an officer title of similar rank
     as determined by the Committee.  Notwithstanding the
     preceding sentences, the term "Eligible Officer" shall not
     include an individual who entered into a Prior Agreement
     with Wal-Mart unless such individual consents to
     participation in the Plan on the terms and conditions herein
     set forth.

          (i)  Fiscal Year means the twelve (12)-month period
     commencing on February 1 and ending on January 31.

          (j)  A Participant is deemed to have engaged in Gross
     Misconduct if the Committee determines that the Participant
     has engaged in conduct inimical to the best interests of Wal-
     Mart or any Related Affiliate.  Examples of conduct inimical
     to the best interests of Wal-Mart or its Related Affiliates
     include, without limitation, disclosure of confidential
     information in violation of Wal-Mart's Statement of Ethics,
     theft, the commission of a felony or a crime of moral
     turpitude, gross misconduct or similar serious offenses.

          (k)  Incentive Payments means the amounts credited to a
     Participant's Account:  (1) in accordance with Section 4.2
     below; and (2) a Participant's Prior Agreement(s).

          (l)  Participant means any Eligible Officer who defers
     compensation or bonuses under the Plan.  An individual
     remains a Participant in the Plan until the Participant's
     Plan benefits have been fully distributed.

          (m)  Related Affiliates means a business or entity that
     is, directly or indirectly, eighty percent (80%) or more
     owned by Wal-Mart.

          (n)  Retirement means a Participant's Termination of
     Employment on or after the Participant's attainment of age
     fifty-five (55).

          (o)  Termination of Employment means a Participant
     ceasing to be actively employed by Wal-Mart and its Related
     Affiliates.  Termination of Employment does not include the
     transfer of a Participant from the employ of Wal-Mart to a
     Related Affiliate or vice versa, or a transfer between Wal-
     Mart's Related Affiliates.

          (p)  Unforeseeable Emergency means a severe financial
     hardship to the Participant resulting from a sudden and
     unexpected illness or accident of the Participant or a
     Participant's dependent (as defined in Code Section 152(a)),
     the loss of the Participant's property due to casualty, or
     other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances
     arising as a result of events beyond the control of the
     Participant.  An Unforeseeable Emergency does not exist to
     the extent such hardship is or may be relieved:

               (1)  through reimbursement or compensation by
          insurance or otherwise;

               (2)  by liquidation of the Participant's assets,
          to the extent the liquidation of such assets would
          itself  not cause severe financial hardship; or

               (3)  by cessation of deferrals under this Plan.

     The need to send a Participant's child to college or the
     desire to purchase a home does not constitute an
     Unforeseeable Emergency.  The existence of an Unforeseeable
     Emergency will be determined by the Committee, in its sole
     discretion, based upon the Participant's facts and
     circumstance and in accordance with restrictions imposed by
     the Code or guidance thereunder.

          (q)  Valuation Date means the January 31 of each Fiscal
     Year.


                          ARTICLE III
               DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND BONUSES --
                    ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTS

     3.1  Deferred Compensation.

     Prior to each Fiscal Year, each Eligible Officer may elect
to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer's base
compensation to be paid by Wal-Mart for such Fiscal Year.
Amounts deferred (the "Deferred Compensation") will be deferred
pro ratably for each payroll period of the Fiscal Year.  All
deferral elections made under this Section 3.1 must be:  (a) made
on forms approved by the Committee; and (b) filed with Wal-Mart
no later than the January 31 preceding the Fiscal Year for which
the deferral election is to be effective.  Once made for a Fiscal
Year, a deferral election may not be revoked, changed or
modified.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event
an Eligible Officer ceases to be employed as an Eligible Officer,
such former Eligible Officer's deferral election shall
automatically cease with respect to compensation earned on or
after the individual ceases to be an Eligible Officer.  A
deferral election for one (1) Fiscal Year will not automatically
be given effect for a subsequent Fiscal Year, so that if
deferrals are desired for a subsequent Fiscal Year, a separate
election must be made by the Eligible Officer for such Fiscal
Year.


     3.2  Deferred Bonuses.

     Prior to each Fiscal Year, each Eligible Officer may elect
to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer's bonus (if
any) for such Fiscal Year under the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
Management Incentive Plan for Officers.  All bonus deferral
elections made under this Section 3.2 must be:  (a) made on forms
approved by the Committee; and (b) filed with Wal-Mart no later
than the January 31 preceding the Fiscal Year in which falls the
period of service for which such bonus (if any) is payable,
regardless of the Fiscal Year in which such bonus is paid.  Once
made for a Fiscal Year, a bonus deferral election may not be
revoked, changed or modified.  Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, in the event an Eligible Officer ceases to be employed
as an Eligible Officer, such former Eligible Officer's bonus
deferral election shall automatically cease with respect to that
portion of a bonus earned on or after the date the individual
ceases to be an Eligible Officer.  For this purpose, the portion
of a bonus earned on or after ceasing to be an Eligible Officer
shall be determined by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in such Fiscal
Year in which the individual ceased to be an Eligible Officer,
and the denominator of which is the total calendar days in such
Fiscal Year.  A bonus deferral election for one (1) Fiscal Year
will not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Fiscal
Year, so that if deferrals are desired for a subsequent Fiscal
Year, a separate election must be made by the Eligible Officer
for such Fiscal Year.

     3.3  Establishment of Accounts.

     The Deferred Compensation, Deferred Bonuses, and Incentive
Payments will be credited to a bookkeeping account ("Account")
established by Wal-Mart on behalf of each Participant.  The
Deferred Compensation will be credited to the Participant's
Account as of the last day of the Fiscal Year during which the
Deferred Compensation would otherwise be payable to the
Participant.  The Deferred Bonus will be credited to the
Participant's Account as of the February 1 following the Fiscal
Year in which falls the period of service for which such bonus is
payable.  The Incentive Payments will be credited to the
Participant's Account as of the last day of the Fiscal Year
specified in Section 4.2 or the Participant's Prior Agreement(s).
A Participant's Account, including earnings credited thereto,
will be maintained by Wal-Mart until all of the Plan
Participant's benefits have been paid in full.

     3.4  Nature of Accounts.

     Each Participant's Account will be used solely as a
measuring device to determine the amount to be paid a Participant
under this Plan.  The Accounts do not constitute, nor will they
be treated as, property or a trust fund of any kind.  All amounts
at any time attributable to a Participant's Account will be, and
remain, the sole property of Wal-Mart.  A Participant's rights
hereunder are limited to the right to receive Plan benefits as
provided herein.  The Plan represents an unsecured promise by Wal-
Mart to pay the benefits provided by the Plan.

     3.5  Annual Valuation of Accounts.

     Each Participant's Account will be valued annually as of
each Valuation Date.  The value of an Account as of any
applicable Valuation Date is the sum of the Account value as of
the immediately preceding Valuation Date, the Deferred
Compensation and Incentive Payments allocated as of the
applicable Valuation Date, the Deferred Bonuses allocated as of
the February 1 following the preceding Valuation Date, and the
equivalent of interest credited to the Account under Section 4.1
as of the applicable Valuation Date, less any distributions for
Unforeseeable Emergencies since the preceding Valuation Date but
on or before the applicable Valuation Date.

                           ARTICLE IV
           ADDITIONS TO ACCOUNTS -- CREDITED EARNINGS
                     AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS

     4.1  Credited Annual Earnings.

     For each Fiscal Year a Participant's Account will be
credited with the equivalent of interest at the per annum rate
established for such Fiscal Year by the Compensation Committee of
the Wal-Mart Board of Directors. The per annum rate may be
increased or decreased for any Fiscal Year to reflect changes in
prevailing interest rates, as determined at the sole discretion
of the Compensation Committee.  Except for a Fiscal Year in which
a Participant receives a distribution due to an Unforeseeable
Emergency, the amount to be credited to a Participant's Account
as of any Valuation Date is the sum of:  (a) the applicable per
annum rate multiplied by the Participant's Account value as of
the immediately preceding Valuation Date; and (b) fifty percent
(50%) of the applicable per annum rate multiplied by the sum of
(1) the Participant's Deferred Compensation for the Fiscal Year
ending on the Valuation Date and (2) the Participant's Deferred
Bonuses allocated on the February 1 of the Fiscal Year ending on
the Valuation Date.

     For a Fiscal Year in which a Participant receives a distri-
bution due to an Unforeseeable Emergency, the amount to be
credited to the Participant's Account as of the applicable
Valuation Date is the sum of:  (a) an equivalent amount of pro
rata interest on the Participant's Account value as of the
preceding Valuation Date based upon the number of full calendar
months in the Fiscal Year which the Account was not reduced due
to the distribution; (b) an equivalent amount of pro rata
interest on the Account value immediately after the distribution
based upon the number of calendar months in the Fiscal Year in
which the Participant's Account was reduced; and (c) fifty
percent (50%) of the applicable per annum rate multiplied by the
sum of (1) the Participant's Deferred Compensation for the Fiscal
Year ending on the Valuation Date and (2) the Participant's
Deferred Bonuses allocated on the February 1 of the Fiscal Year
ending on the Valuation Date.

     4.2  Incentive Payments.

     The Incentive Payments described below will be credited to a
Participant's Account.  Incentive Payments awarded and credited
to a Participant's Account under a Prior Agreement (such
Incentive Payments were previously referred to as "incentive
bonuses" under the Prior Agreements), and credited interest
thereon, will remain credited to a Participant's Account
hereunder as of January 31, 1996.  Thereafter, a Participant's
entitlement to an Incentive Payment will be governed by this
Section 4.2, including any Incentive Payment which may be awarded
with respect to recognized Deferred Compensation (and credited
earnings thereon) deferred under a Prior Agreement.  Incentive
Payments hereunder shall not duplicate any Incentive Payment
awarded and credited under a Prior Agreement as of January 31,
1996.

          (a)  The Incentive Payments provided in this Section
     apply to a Participant's recognized Deferred Compensation
     for a Fiscal Year and credited Plan earnings thereon.  Incen-
     tive Payments are separately awarded based upon a
     Participant's recognized Deferred Compensation for a given
     Fiscal Year and credited Plan earnings thereon.

          (b)  The amount of an Incentive Payment is based on the
     Participant's recognized Deferred Compensation for a Fiscal
     Year, plus credited Plan earnings on such sums through and
     including the Incentive Payment award date.  The amount by
     which a Participant's Deferred Compensation for a Fiscal
     Year exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Participant's base
     compensation will not be recognized in computing an
     Incentive Payment. Base compensation for this purpose means
     the Participant's annual base rate of compensation for such
     Fiscal Year.  Credited Plan earnings on such nonrecognized
     Deferred Compensation are likewise not taken into account in
     determining the amount of an Incentive Payment.  In
     addition, a Participant's Deferred Bonuses or credited Plan
     earnings thereon are not taken into account in computing the
     Participant's Incentive Payments.

          (c)  If a Participant remains continuously employed
     with Wal-Mart or its Related Affiliates for a period of ten
     (10) consecutive full Fiscal Years, beginning with the
     February 1 of the first Fiscal Year in which the Participant
     had a Deferred Compensation election in effect under this
     Plan or a Prior Agreement, and ending with the January 31 of
     the tenth (10th) Fiscal Year of such period, an Incentive
     Payment will be credited to the Participant's Account as of
     the January 31 of such tenth (10th) Fiscal Year.  The
     Incentive Payment will be equal to twenty percent (20%) of
     the Participant's recognized Deferred Compensation for ten
     (10), but not less than five (5), Fiscal Years (i.e., the
     first six (6) Fiscal Years of such ten (10)-year period),
     plus credited Plan earnings thereon through the award date.
     For each full Fiscal Year thereafter in which the
     Participant remains continuously employed with Wal-Mart or
     its Related Affiliates, an Incentive Payment will be
     credited to the Participant's Account as of the January 31
     of such Fiscal Year.  Such Incentive Payment will be equal
     to twenty percent (20%) of the Participant's recognized
     Deferred Compensation for the first Fiscal Year of the five
     (5)- consecutive Fiscal Year period ending on the January 31
     award date, plus credited Plan earnings thereon through the
     award date.

          (d)  If a Participant remains continuously employed
     with Wal-Mart or its Related Affiliates for a period of
     fifteen (15) consecutive full Fiscal Years, beginning with
     the February 1 of the first Fiscal Year in which the
     Participant had a Deferred Compensation election in effect
     under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, and ending with the
     January 31 of the fifteenth (15th) Fiscal Year of such
     period, an Incentive Payment will be credited to the
     Participant's Account as of the January 31 of such fifteenth
     (15th) Fiscal Year.  The Incentive Payment will be equal to
     ten percent (10%) of the Participant's recognized Deferred
     Compensation for fifteen (15), but not less than ten (10),
     Fiscal Years (i.e., the first six (6) Fiscal Years of such
     fifteen (15)-year period), plus credited Plan earnings
     thereon through the award date.  For each full Fiscal Year
     thereafter in which the Participant remains continuously
     employed with Wal-Mart or its Related Affiliates, an
     Incentive Payment will be credited to the Participant's
     Account as of the January 31 of such Fiscal Year.  Such
     Incentive Payment will be equal to ten percent (10%) of the
     Participant's recognized Deferred Compensation for the first
     Fiscal Year of a ten (10)-consecutive Fiscal Year period
     ending on the January 31 award date, plus credited Plan
     earnings thereon through the award date.  The Incentive
     Payments provided in this Section 4.2(d) shall not take into
     account Incentive Payments credited under Section 4.2(c) or
     credited Plan earnings thereon.

          (e)  The Incentive Payments provided in this Section
     4.2(e) only apply if a Participant has been a Participant
     under the Plan (or a Prior Agreement) for five (5) or more
     full Fiscal Years and if the Participant incurs a
     Retirement, Early Retirement, death or Disability before
     satisfaction of the ten (10)- or fifteen (15)-year periods
     described in Sections 4.2 (c) and (d) above.  In that event,
     only the Incentive Payment next to be credited (i.e., twenty
     percent (20%) or ten percent (10%)) will be credited to the
     Participant's Account as provided in this Section 4.2(e).
     In the event the Participant had not yet been awarded or
     credited with a twenty percent (20%) Incentive Payment under
     Section 4.2(c), the Incentive Payment provided by this
     Section 4.2(e) will be based upon the ratio of (1) the
     number of full Fiscal Years worked since and including the
     first Fiscal Year in which the Participant had a Deferred
     Compensation election in effect under this Plan or a Prior
     Agreement, to (2) ten (10), multiplied by twenty percent
     (20%).  Such Incentive Payment will be based upon recognized
     amounts for the Fiscal Years which would otherwise have been
     considered in calculating the Participant's first Incentive
     Payment under Section 4.2(c).  If the Participant has been
     awarded a twenty percent (20%) Incentive Payment provided in
     Section 4.2 (c), the Incentive Payment provided by this
     Section 4.2(e) will be based upon the ratio of (1) the
     number of full Fiscal Years worked since the award date of
     the initial twenty percent (20%) Incentive Payment, to (2)
     five (5), multiplied by ten percent (10%).  Such Incentive
     Payment will be based upon recognized amounts for the Fiscal
     Years which would otherwise have been considered in
     calculating the Participant's first Incentive Payment under
     Section 4.2(d).  The Incentive Payment provided under this
     Section 4.2(e) will be determined and credited to the
     Participant's Account as of the date the Participant's Plan
     benefits are distributed in a lump sum payment.  If,
     however, a Participant's benefits are to be distributed in
     installments, the amounts provided under this Section 4.2(e)
     will be determined and credited to the Participant's Account
     as of the Valuation Date on which installments are based.

                               ARTICLE V
                        PAYMENT OF PLAN BENEFITS

     5.1  Distribution Restrictions.

     Except in the event of a Participant's Unforeseeable Emergency,
Plan benefits will not be payable to a Participant prior to the
earliest occurrence of the Participant's Retirement, Early
Retirement, Termination of Employment, Disability or death.

     5.2  Termination Benefits.

     (a)  General.

     In the event of a Participant's Termination of Employment for
reasons other than the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement,
Disability or death, the Participant's Plan benefits will be
distributed in a lump sum within sixty (60) days after the end of the
calendar month in which the Termination of Employment occurs.

     (b)  Termination on Last Business Day of Fiscal Year.

     If the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs on the
last business day (excluding for this purpose, Saturday and Sunday)
of a Fiscal Year, the lump sum amount will be the sum of: (a) the
value of the Participant's Account, as determined under Section 3.5,
as of the Valuation Date coincident with or immediately following the
Participant's Termination of Employment;  (b) the Participant's
Deferred Bonus allocated as of the February 1 following such
Valuation Date; and (c) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent
(determined at the per annum rate in effect for the Fiscal Year in
which distribution occurs) on the sum of the amounts determined in
(a) and (b) through the date of distribution based upon the number of
calendar days since such Valuation Date.

     (c)  Termination on Other Than Last Business Day of Fiscal
Year.

     If the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs on a date
other than the last business day (excluding for this purpose,
Saturday and Sunday) of a Fiscal Year, the lump sum amount will equal
the sum of:  (a) the value of the Participant's Account as of the
Valuation Date immediately preceding Termination of Employment; (b) a
pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the per annum
rate in effect for a Fiscal Year under Section 4.1) on the
Participant's Account value as of such immediately preceding
Valuation Date based upon the number of calendar days since such
Valuation Date through the date of distribution; (c) the sum of the
Participant's Deferred Compensation for the Fiscal Year in which
Termination of Employment occurs and the Participant's Deferred Bonus
allocated as of the February 1 of the Fiscal year in which
Termination of Employment occurs; and (d) a pro rata amount of
interest equivalent (determined at one-half (1/2) the per annum rate
in effect for a Fiscal Year under Section 4.1) on the amount
determined in (c) based upon the number of calendar days since the
Valuation Date immediately preceding Termination of Employment
through date of distribution.

     (d)  Death.

     In the event of a Participant's death before payment of the
amounts provided by this Section 5.2, such amounts will be paid in a
lump sum to the Participant's beneficiary designated under Section
5.5 at the time provided herein.

     5.3  Retirement, Early Retirement, and Disability Benefits.

     (a)  General.

     In the event of a Participant's Termination of Employment due to
the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability, the
Participant's Plan benefits will be distributed in a lump sum or in
substantially equal annual installments over a period not to exceed
fifteen (15) years, in accordance with the Participant's distribution
election given effect under the provisions of Section 5.6 below.

     (b)  Lump Sum Distributions.

     If distribution is to be made in the form of a lump sum, the
Participant's Plan benefits will be distributed within sixty (60)
days after the end of the calendar month in which the Retirement,
Early Retirement or Disability occurs.  If the Participant's
Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability occurs on the last
business day (excluding for this purpose Saturday and Sunday) of a
Fiscal Year, the lump sum amount will be the sum of:  (1) the value
of the Participant's Account, as determined under Section 3.5, as of
the Valuation Date coincident with or immediately following the
Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability;  (2) the
Participant's Deferred Bonus allocated as of the February 1 following
such Valuation Date; (3) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent
(determined at the per annum rate in effect for the Fiscal Year in
which distribution occurs) on the sum of the amounts determined in
(1) and (2) through the date of distribution based upon the number of
calendar days since such Valuation Date; and (4) the Participant's
Incentive Payment (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(e).

     If the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability
occurs on a date other than the last business day (excluding for this
purpose Saturday and Sunday) of a Fiscal Year, the lump sum amount
will equal the sum of:  (1) the value of the Participant's Account as
of the Valuation Date immediately preceding Retirement, Early
Retirement or Disability; (2) a pro rata amount of interest
equivalent (determined at the per annum rate in effect for a Fiscal
Year under Section 4.1) on the Participant's Account value as of such
immediately preceding Valuation Date based upon the number of
calendar days since such Valuation Date through the date of
distribution; (3) the Participant's Deferred Compensation for the
Fiscal Year in which Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability
occurs and the Participant's Deferred Bonus allocated as of the
February 1 of the Fiscal Year in which Retirement, Early Retirement
or Disability occurs; (4) the Participant's Incentive Payment (if
any) as provided in Section 4.2(e); and (5) a pro rata amount of
interest equivalent (determined at one-half (1/2) the per annum rate
in effect for a Fiscal Year under Section 4.1) on the amount deter-
mined in (3) based upon the number of calendar days since the
Valuation Date immediately preceding Retirement, Early Retirement or
Disability through the date of distribution.

     (c)  Installment Distributions.

     If distribution is to be made in the form of annual install-
ments, the Participant's installments will be based upon the value of
the Participant's Account, as determined under Section 3.5, as of the
Valuation Date coincident with or immediately following the
Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability, plus any
Deferred Bonus allocated as of the following February 1.  The Plan
benefits determined above will be paid in equal annual installments
in an amount which would fully amortize a loan equal to such Plan
benefits over the period covered by the installment period (such
period commencing on the February 1 following the Valuation Date the
Participant's Account is valued under this Section), with interest
calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Fiscal Year in
which the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability
occurs.  The first installment will be paid on the second January 31
coincident with or following the Participant's Retirement, Early
Retirement or Disability, and continue on each successive January 31
until the Participant's benefits are distributed in full.

     (d)  Death.

     In the event of a Participant's death before full payment of
Plan benefits under this Section 5.3, payment shall be made (or
continue to be made) to the Participant's beneficiary designated
under Section 5.5 in the same form as elected by the Participant for
distribution of Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability benefits.

     5.4  Death Benefits.

     (a)  General.

     In the event of a Participant's Termination of Employment due to
the Participant's death, the Participant's Plan benefits will be
distributed in a lump sum or in substantially equal annual
installments over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years, in
accordance with the Participant's distribution election given effect
under the provisions of Section 5.6 below.  Amounts will be
distributed to the beneficiary designated under 5.5 below.

     (b)  Lump Sum Distributions.

     If distribution is to be made in the form of a lump sum, the
Participant's Plan benefits will be distributed within sixty (60)
days after the end of the calendar month in which the Participant's
death occurs.  If the Participant's death occurs on the last business
day (excluding for this purpose Saturday and Sunday) of a Fiscal
Year, the lump sum amount will be the sum of:  (1) the value of the
Participant's Account, as determined under Section 3.5, as of the
Valuation Date coincident with or immediately following the
Participant's death; (2) the Participant's Deferred Bonus allocated
as of the February 1 following such Valuation Date; (3) a pro rata
amount of interest equivalent (determined at the per annum rate in
effect for the Fiscal Year in which distribution occurs) on the sum
of the amounts determined in (1) and (2) through the date of
distribution based upon the number of calendar days since such
Valuation Date; and (4) the Participant's Incentive Payment (if any)
as provided in Section 4.2(e).

     If the Participant's death occurs on a date other the last
business day (excluding for this purpose Saturday and Sunday) of a
Fiscal Year, the lump sum amount will equal the sum of:  (1) the
value of the Participant's Account as of the Valuation Date immedi-
ately preceding the Participant's death; (2) a pro rata amount of
interest equivalent (determined at the per annum rate in effect for a
Fiscal Year on the Participant's Account value as of the immediately
preceding Valuation Date based upon the number of full calendar days
since such Valuation Date through date of distribution; (3) the
Participant's Deferred Compensation for the Fiscal Year in which the
Participant's death occurs and the Participant's Deferred Bonus
allocated as of the February 1 of the Fiscal Year in which the
Participant's death occurs; (4) the Participant's Incentive Payment
(if any) as provided in Section 4.2(e); and (5) a pro rata amount of
interest equivalent (determined at one-half (1/2) the per annum rate
in effect for a Fiscal Year on the amount determined in (3) based
upon the number of calendar days since the Valuation Date immediately
preceding the Participant's death through the date of distribution.

     (c)  Installment Distributions.

     If distribution is to be made in the form of annual install
ments, the installments will be based upon the value of the
Participant's Account, as determined under Section 3.5, as of the
Valuation Date coincident with or immediately following the
Participant's death, plus any Deferred Bonus allocated as of the
following February 1.  The Plan benefits determined above will be
paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully
amortize a loan equal to such Plan benefits over the period covered
by the installment period (such period commencing on the February 1
following the Valuation Date the Participant's Account is valued
under this Section), with interest calculated at the per annum rate
in effect for the Fiscal Year in which the Participant's death
occurs.  The first installment will be paid on the second January 31
coincident with or following the Participant's death, and continue on
each successive January 31 until the Participant's benefits are
distributed in full.

     5.5  Designation of Beneficiary.

     A Participant may, by written instrument delivered to Wal-Mart
on forms prescribed by the Committee, designate primary and
contingent beneficiaries to receive any benefit payments which may be
payable under this Plan following the Participant's death, and may
designate the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to receive
such payments.  A Participant may change such designations from time
to time and the last written designation filed with Wal-Mart prior to
the Participant's death will control.  In the event no beneficiary is
designated, or if the designated beneficiary predeceases the
Participant, payment shall be payable to the Participant's estate.
For this purpose, a Participant's most recent written beneficiary
designation properly filed under a Prior Agreement shall continue to
be given effect until otherwise modified in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.

     5.6  Form of Distribution.

     If a Participant's Termination of Employment is due to the
Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement, Disability or death, at
the Participant's election distribution may be made in a lump sum or
in substantially equal annual installments over a period not to
exceed fifteen (15) years.  A Participant may file a distribution
election with Wal-Mart on forms prescribed by the Committee.  A
distribution election, once given effect under this Section 5.6, will
apply to the Participant's total Plan benefits.  A Participant  may,
however, file a separate election for death benefits payable under
Section 5.4.  To be given effect under this Section 5.6, any
distribution election for benefits payable under Section 5.3 must
have been filed with Wal-Mart at least twenty-four (24) full calendar
months before the occurrence of an event entitling the Participant to
a distribution thereunder.  If a Participant's distribution election
has not been on file with Wal-Mart for the full twenty-four (24)-
month period, it will not be recognized or given effect by the Plan.
In that event, distribution will be made in accordance with the
Participant's most recent distribution election which was filed with
Wal-Mart at least twenty-four (24) months prior to the Participant's
Retirement, Early Retirement, or Disability.  The twenty-four (24)
month period provided above shall not apply to amounts payable under
Section 5.4.  For purposes of this Section 5.6, a Participant's last
distribution election filed with Wal-Mart under a Prior Agreement
will be given effect for the Participant's total Plan benefits until
superseded or amended by the Participant in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, except that death benefits under Section
5.4 will be paid in a lump sum unless an affirmative election to the
contrary is filed by the Participant.  If the Participant has not
been a Participant in the Plan for at least twenty-four (24) months
prior to the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement, or Disabili-
ty, the Participant's initial distribution election filed with Wal-
Mart will be given effect.

     5.7  Reductions Arising from a Participant's Gross Misconduct.

     A Participant's Plan benefits are contingent upon the Partici-
pant not engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with Wal-Mart or
any Related Affiliate, or during such additional period as provided
in Wal-Mart's Statement of Ethics.  Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in the event the Committee determines that the
Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed
period:  (a) the Participant shall forfeit all Incentive Payments,
and credited Plan earnings thereon; and (b) earnings credited to the
Participant's Account derived from Deferred Compensation and Deferred
Bonuses shall be recalculated for each Fiscal Year to reflect the
amount which would otherwise have been credited if the applicable per
annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect
for such Fiscal Year.  Under no circumstances will a Participant
forfeit any portion of the Participant's Deferred Compensation or
Deferred Bonuses.  Any payments received hereunder by a Participant
(or the Participant's beneficiary) are contingent upon the Partici-
pant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while
employed with Wal-Mart or any Related Affiliate, or during such
additional period as provided in Wal-Mart's Statement of Business
Ethics.  If the Committee determines, after payment of amounts
hereunder, that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct
during the prescribed period, the Participant (or the Participant's
beneficiary) shall repay to Wal-Mart any amount in excess of that to
which the Participant is entitled under this Section 5.7.

     5.8  Distributions for Unforeseeable Emergencies.

     In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee, in
its sole and absolute discretion and upon written application of such
Participant, may direct immediate distribution of all or a portion of
the Participant's Plan benefits.  The Committee will permit
distribution because of an Unforeseeable Emergency only to the extent
reasonably needed to satisfy the emergency need.

     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions
of this paragraph apply in the event a Participant receives a
distribution under this Section 5.8, the Participant's Termination of
Employment for any reason occurs on a date other than the last
business day of a Fiscal Year (excluding for this purpose Saturday or
Sunday), and the Participant's benefits hereunder for any reason are
paid in the same Fiscal Year in which the Participant received a
distribution for Unforeseeable Emergencies under this Section 5.8.
In that event, the Participant's lump sum amount calculated under
Sections 5.2, 5.3, or 5.4 will be reduced by the amount distributed
under this Section 5.8 and the applicable interest equivalent will be
calculated in a manner consistent with Section 4.1.

                             ARTICLE VI

          (b)  may review pertinent documents; and

          (c)  may submit issues and comments in writing.

reasonable period of time, but not later than one hundred twenty
(120) days after receipt of a request for review.  The decision on
review will be in writing and shall include the specific reasons for
the denial and the specific references to the pertinent Plan

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Results of Operations

Revenues
Sales for the three fiscal years ended January 31, and the respective total and 
comparable store percentage increases over the prior year were:

                                       Total       Comparable
Fiscal              Sales             Company        Store
Year             (in millions)       Increases     Increases
1996                $93,627             13%            4%
1995                 82,494             22%            7%
1994                 67,344             21%            6%

The sales increase of 13% in fiscal 1996 compared with fiscal 1995 was 
attributable to the Company's expansion program and comparative store sales 
increases of 4%. Expansion for fiscal 1996 included the opening of 92 Wal-Mart 
stores, 92 Supercenters (including the conversion of 80 Wal-Mart stores), 9 
SAM'S Clubs and 50 International units. International sales accounted for 
approximately 2.1% of the sales increase with the remainder primarily 
attributed to Wal-Mart stores and Supercenters. SAM'S Clubs sales as a 
percentage of total sales decreased from 22.9% in fiscal 1995 to 20.4% in fiscal
1996.
    The sales increase of 22% in fiscal 1995 compared with fiscal 1994 was 
attributable to the Company's domestic expansion of 109 Wal-Mart stores, 75 
Supercenters (including the conversion of 69 Wal-Mart stores), and 21 SAM'S 
Clubs; comparative store sales increases of 7%; and the entry into the Canadian 
market through the purchase of 122 stores from Woolworth Canada, Inc., a 
subsidiary of Woolworth Corporation. SAM'S Clubs sales as a percentage of 
total sales increased by 1.1%, part of which was attributable to the PACE
units acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994. Canadian store sales 
accounted for 1.5% of total sales in fiscal 1995.

</TABLE>

Costs and Expenses
Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased .1% in both fiscal 1996
and fiscal 1995 when compared to the preceding year. The change in fiscal
1996 is comprised of an increase of approximately .3% due to a larger
percentage of consolidated sales from departments within Wal-Mart stores
which have lower markon percents, and to the Company's continuing
commitment to always providing low prices. This increase is offset
because the SAM'S Clubs comprised a lower percentage of consolidated
sales in 1996 at a lower contribution to gross margin than the stores.
The increase in fiscal 1995 is primarily due to a larger percentage of
consolidated sales attributable to SAM'S Clubs resulting in part from the
addition of the PACEClubs. The cost of sales in SAM'S Clubs is
significantly higher as a percentage of sales than in Wal-Mart stores due
to a lower markon on purchases.
        Operating, selling, and general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales increased .4% and .2%, respectively, in each of the
last two fiscal years when compared to the previous year. Approximately
 .2% of the increase in fiscal 1996 was due to increases in payroll and
related benefit costs. The remainder of the increase resulted primarily
from a lower percentage of sales attributable to SAM'S Clubs and a higher
percentage of sales attributable to international operations. SAM'S Clubs
operating, selling, and general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales are lower than the Wal-Mart stores and Supercenters
while international expenses are slightly higher. The increase in fiscal
1995 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the Canadian stores
and higher payroll and related benefit costs.
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 121
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of" was issued in March 1995. The statement
requires entities to review long-lived assets and certain intangible
assets in certain circumstances, and if the value of the assets is
impaired, an impairment loss shall be recognized. This statement will be
effective for the Company's fiscal year ending January 31, 1997. The
Company's existing accounting policie s are such that this pronouncement
will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.
        "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," SFAS No. 123, was
issued in October 1995 and will be effective for the Company's fiscal
year ending January 31, 1997. The statement relates to the measurement of
compensation of stock options issued to employees. The statement gives
entities a choice of recognizing related compensation expense by adopting
a new fair value method determination or to continue to measure
compensation using the former standard. If the former standard for
measurement is elected, SFAS No. 123 requires supplemental disclosure to
show the effects of using the new measurement criteria. The Company
intends to continue using the measurement prescribed by the former
standard, and accordingly, this pronouncement will not have an effect on
the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Interest Cost
Interest cost increased in fiscal 1996 and 1995 due to increased
indebtedness and increased average short-term borrowing rates in each of
the years. The increased indebtedness is due to the Company's expansion
program. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on interest and debt.

Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 37.0% and 37.1% in fiscal 1996 and 1995
respectively. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on income taxes.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow Information
Cash flow provided from operations was $2.4 billion in fiscal 1996. These
funds combined with long-term borrowings of $1 billion and net short-term
borrowings of $.7 billion were used to finance capital expenditures of
$3.6 billion, to pay dividends, provide working capital, and to fund the
operation of subsidiaries.
Borrowing Information
The Company had committed lines of credit of $1,900 million and informal
lines totaling an additional $2,450 million with 35 banks which were used
to support short-term borrowing and commercial paper. These lines of
credit and their anticipated cyclical increases will be sufficient to
finance the seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and interim
financing requirements for stores developed with sale/leaseback or other
long-term financing objectives.
        Favorable debt market conditions combined with the Company's
ability to generate significant cash flows from operations have allowed
the Company to aggressively expand during the past three years. In fiscal
1996, the Company borrowed $1 billion at interest rates ranging from 6
1/8% to 7% for terms of three to seven years.  Although the Company has
borrowed to support the expansion, debt and equity have increased
proportionately during the past three years. The Company's debt
(including obligations under capital leases) to equity ratio was .74:1 at
the end of fiscal 1996 compared to .77:1 and .75:1 at the end of fiscal
1995 and 1994, respectively. In view of the Company's significant working
capital, its consistent ability to generate working capital from
operations and the availability of external financing, the Company
foresees no difficulty in providing funds necessary to fulfill its
working capital needs and to finance its estimated $3.5 billion capital
expansion plan in fiscal 1997.

Foreign Currency Translation
The Company has operations in Puerto Rico, Canada, and Argentina, and
through joint ventures in Mexico and Brazil. All foreign operations are
measured in their local currencies with the exception of Brazil,
operating in a highly inflationary economy, which reports operations
using U.S. dollars. All foreign operations as a group are insignificant
to the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial
position. The foreign currency translation adjustment of $412 and $256
million in fiscal 1996 and 1995, respectively, is primarily due to
operations in Mexico. In fiscal 1995 the value of the peso dropped
significantly in relation to the dollar and continued to decline in
fiscal 1996. The Company continues to evaluate strategies to minimize the
financial risk of currency devaluation. Although exposure to this risk
exists, any further devaluation of the peso or other currencies should
not significantly impact the Company's consolidated operations or
financial position.

Expansion
Domestically, the Company plans to open 60 to 70 new Wal-Mart stores, and
100 to 110 Supercenters. Approximately 90 of the Supercenters will come
from relocations or expansions of existing Wal-Mart stores. The Company
also plans to open 10 new SAM'S Clubs and three distribution centers.
International expansion includes 25 to 30 new Wal-Mart stores,
Supercenters, and SAM'S Clubs in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China,
Indonesia, Mexico and Puerto Rico.
        Total capital expenditures for 1997 are not expected to exceed $3.5
billion. The Company plans to primarily finance expansion with operating
cash flows. The Company may also provide for cash needs through short-
term borrowings backed up by the credit lines discussed above and also
may sell $751 million of public debt utilizing shelf registration
statements previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to provide for other cash needs.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Segment information
The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation
of mass merchandising stores located in all 50 states, Puerto Rico,
Canada, and Argentina, and through joint ventures in Mexico and Brazil.

Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers investments with a maturity of three months or less
when purchased to be "cash equivalents."

Inventories
Inventories are stated principally at cost (last-in, first-out), which is
not in excess of market, using the retail method for inventories in
stores.

Pre-opening costs
Costs associated with the opening of stores are expensed during the first
full month of operations. The costs are carried as prepaid expenses prior
to the store opening.

Interest during construction
In order that interest costs properly reflect only that portion relating
to current operations, interest on borrowed funds during the construction
of property, plant, and equipment is capitalized. Interest costs
capitalized were $50 million, $70 million, and $65 million in 1996, 1995,
and 1994, respectively.

Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes is
provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the various assets. For income tax purposes, accelerated methods are used
with recognition of deferred income taxes for the resulting temporary
differences.

Long-lived assets
In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, which requires impairment losses
to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of
impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount.
Statement  121 also addresses the accounting for long-lived assets that
are expected to be disposed of. The Company will adopt Statement 121 in
the first quarter of 1997 and, based on current circumstances, does not
believe the effect of adoption will be material.

Operating, selling, and general and administrative expenses
Buying, warehousing, and occupancy costs are included in operating,
selling, and general and administrative expenses.

Net income per share
Net income per share is based on the weighted average outstanding common
shares. The dilutive effect of stock options is insignificant and
consequently has been excluded from the earnings per share computations.

Stock options
Proceeds from the sale of common stock issued under the stock option
plans and related tax benefits which accrue to the Company are accounted
for as capital transactions, and no charges or credits are made to income
in connection with the plans.

Estimates and assumptions
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

    The Company has agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms
of its note and debenture agreements the most restrictive of which
relates to amounts of additional secured debt and long-term leases.

    The Company has entered into sale/leaseback transactions involving
buildings while retaining title to the underlying land. These
transactions were accounted for as financings and are included in long-
term debt and the annual maturities schedules above. The resulting
obligations are amortized over the lease terms. Future minimum lease
payments for each of the five succeeding years as of January 31, 1996 are

    The fair value of the Company's long-term debt approximates $8,960
million based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for
similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying amount of the short-
term borrowings approximates fair value.

    As of January 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company had letters of credit
outstanding totaling $551 and $580 million, respectively. These letters
of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory.

    The Company has guaranteed the indebtedness of a joint venture for
the development of real estate in Puerto Rico. On January 31, 1996, the
amount guaranteed was approximately $85 million. The Company does not
anticipate any joint venture defaults.

    Under shelf registration statements previously filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company may issue debt securities
aggregating $751 million.


3  Defined Contribution Plan

The Company maintains a profit sharing plan under which most full and
many part-time Associates become participants following one year of
employment. Annual contributions, based on the profitability of the
Company, are made at the sole discretion of the Company. Contributions
were $204 million, $175 million, and $166 million in 1996, 1995, and 1994, 
respectively.

5  Acquisitions

In two unrelated cash transactions during fiscal 1994, the Company
acquired selected assets of PACE Membership Warehouses, Inc., including
the right to operate 107 of PACE's former locations, for $830 million,
recording $336 million of goodwill which is being amortized over 25
years.

    In fiscal 1995, the Company acquired selected assets related to 122
Woolco stores in Canada from Woolworth Canada, Inc., a subsidiary of
Woolworth Corporation, for approximately $352 million, recording $221
million of leasehold and location value which is being amortized over 20
years. These transactions have been accounted for as purchases. The
results of operations for the acquired units since the dates of their
acquisitions have been included in the Company's results. Pro forma
results of operations are not presented due to insignificant differences
from the historical results.

6  Stock Option Plans

At January 31, 1996, 75 million shares of common stock were reserved for
issuance under stock option plans. The options granted under the stock
option plans expire 10 years from the date of grant. Options granted
prior to November 1995 may be exercised in nine annual installments.

7  Long-term Lease Obligations

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have long-term leases for
stores and equipment. Rentals (including, for certain leases, amounts
applicable to taxes, insurance, maintenance, other operating expenses,
and contingent rentals) under all operating leases were $531 million in
1996, $479 million in 1995, and $361 million in 1994. Aggregate minimum
annual rentals at January 31, 1996, under non-cancelable leases are as

million, and $27 million in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.
Substantially all of the store leases have renewal options for additional

    The Company has entered into lease commitments for land and buildings
for 34 future locations. These lease commitments with real estate
developers or through sale/leaseback arrangements provide for minimum
rentals for 20 to 25 years, excluding renewal options, which, if
consummated based on current cost estimates, will approximate $32 million
annually over the lease terms.
